            <p>üéµ Welcome to <strong>Music Listening Experiences Blog</strong>, a personal 
                blog dedicated to in-depth music reviews and discussions.</p>

            <p>This music blog originally stemmed off a webpage project that I
                was interested in but never got around to. I figured that using Github Pages
                would be easier than using a self hosting websites given their paywall restrictions. 
                This is also the first project that I have done in HTML, Javascript and CSS 
                of which I am still learning on the side from my university studies.
            </p>

            <p>Back in 2018 I started listening to music on a more analytical level during
                my studies of which the majority of my study hours were spent in the library.
                Admittedly I wasn't a social person but spent most of my time discovering new songs
                based on the limited knowledge about different artists and genres. I still remember 
                searching on Spotify for different random songs I found and just adding them to a general
                playlist until I amassed my first hundred songs. This usually lasted the duration of 
                my study routine (yes I know one hundred songs is a long duration) of which I continued to 
                discover more songs throughout highschool and university. 
            </p>

            <p>Since then, I have listened to over thirty thousand individual songs
                (as windows file manager tells me) and I figured, "Why not write my listening
                experiences somewhere to remember". As a result of this statement, I decided to
                challenge myself to build repository of articles to document some of my most memorable
                experiences. Personally, I listen to genres like Rock, Pop, Metal, Symphonic Metal, 
                J-Pop, Vocaloid, V-tuber, Instrumental, Video Game OSTs Anime OSTs etc but am 
                still actively exploring new songs. </p>
