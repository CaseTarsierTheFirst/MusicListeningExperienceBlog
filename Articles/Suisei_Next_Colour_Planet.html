<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>While stumbling around the youtube wasteland a few years ago during COVID, a blue haired
    idol came up on my reccomendations (when I still had reccomendations enabled) which caught 
    my eye. Unbeknowst to 2020 me, I would be jumping down a very deep rabbit hole of which I would 
    not be ever climbing back out of any time soon. 
</p>
<p>To those who are the uninitiated, Hoshimachi Suisei or referred to as ÊòüË°ó„Åô„ÅÑ„Åõ„ÅÑ is a hololive 
    idol who debuted at the end of 2019. NEXT COLOR PLANET was her second year anniversary song which
    cemented her start as a music idol. The song appeared in the later released 2021 album called Still Stellar Stellar
    as the second song in her album. The song's overall reception was met with high praise with it being featured 
    number 16 on the Billboard Japan. 
</p>
<p>My first experience with the song was through the youtube video, which surprised me at the time given
    its high view count. At the time I only heard of what hololive was but never thought of what they did 
    as a group. The video consisted of a flurry of lyrics and animations and seemed satisfactory, in fact 
    it was really enjoyable to watch. Now with many of the hololive members, usually when they release songs
    they are usually released as singles with maybe an album or two compiling the released singles which
    in this case is just the single shown in the tracklist. 
</p>

<h2>Impressions</h2>
<p>Now getting to impressions, provided this was the first Non-English song I seriously listened to, this single
    song surpised me greatly. As soon as the song started I was met with a pleasant sound of Suisei's vocals
    without any ear piercing highs or straining accompanied by a piano soundtrack. Then the most unusual mix 
    of brass andd bass hit the scene filling the stage with lots of energy. It is unusual (to me at least) when 
    a bass instrument is partnered with a brass instrument basically complementing different ranges in the frequency to
    come out as more disctinct let alone with the vocals and piano. 
</p>
<p>Now since I am only an English speaker, most of the focus does shift to the instruments due to 
    the language barrier. However even listening to the vocals, it made me severly underestimate how well
    they were performed in the song, so well controlled and somehow still prevalent in the fray of instruments.
    The synthesiser was also a largely present element as well where it was used to build energy. Specifically 
    the synthesiser was only majorly present during the bridge as the main instrument while only being used 
    to support the other instruments during the chorus which was an interesting choice by the composer. Near the end 
    of the song, the chorus gives one final round before ending off with a merry sing-a-long.
</p>

<p>Reading the translated lyrics, it was very clear that the song was based on Suisei and the idol performance theming
    and also many references to stars given her first part of her name Hoshi means star or referenced as comet by the hoshiyomis.
    It was interesting that the lyrics closely referenced Suisei's theming of which was not as present in her future releases. 
</p>

<p>The arrangement of the song was done very well and was actually a really good attempt from a idol group. 
    Historically from some of the other groups that I have listened to, the arrangement and mastering would typically
    fall short but not the case here. Suisei's vocals are positioned dead centre in the stage while the piano is off set to the right.
    The brass instruments are positioned centre-left while the bass guitar is positioned with Suisei dead centre. Finally the synthesiser 
    position varies depending on the effects played but are sprinkled around the stage.
</p>

<p>
    There were some shortcoming with the song. The separation of the instruments is not the best with some of the instruments 
    being merged together in some of the busier sections of the song particularly in the centre. Meanwhile
    the instruments do sound quite artificial indicated by some of the notes sounding a bit fuzzy. The difference between
    Suisei's songs in 2020-21 and 2023-2025 becomes apparent by their improved clarity so the mastering process definetly improved greatly 
    Nevertheless these are nitpicks considering that hololive is not a music company first and the song overall was still highly enjoyable.
</p>

<p>The song time is 4:20 minutes which I consider to be way above my reference time of 3:30 minutes which is really good
    as I felt that it wasn't losing out on any potential playback time unlike other songs like bibideba which was released in 2024 which only goes for 2:50 min.
    It was well paced, without any feeling of rushing and played back well on a number of mediums like my phone, laptop, Fiio M11 pro
    and Astell SR15 from Spotify Quality to FLAC 24/96. Finally to top it all off when I read the credits, (yes where its due) I was surprised to know that
    the song was written by Suisei and Takuya Sakai which made me more happy to know that it was somewhat an original creation.
</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall this song was a rollercoaster of experiences that I didn't even know existed. Prior to Suisei, there wasn't any other Japanese singers that
    I ever listened to before. As a result, after listening I was happy to find out that her first album was releasing the following year after <strong>NEXT COLOR PLANET</strong> and that I would have to 
    unfortunately wait around for it to debut. In my eyes, Suisei holds a gold standard for J-pop music through her hard work 
    and determination (especially from Hololive) of which I have thoroughly enjoyed my time listening to, especially the unique instrumentations and song lyrics. Yes 
    this song definetly encapsulates the stereotype of an 'idol' song but it does it in such a way that doesn't come of as sounding harsh, peaky or just plain old repetitive. With this 
    I conclude that this was how I fell in the rabbit hole (and still in it!).
