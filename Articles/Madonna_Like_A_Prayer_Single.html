<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> Six months ago, an unlikely artist was featured in one of the biggest movies of 2024.
    <strong>Like a Prayer<strong> from Madonna reached the ears of millions of people during its 
    debut in the trailers of Deadpool & Wolverine reviving the song's once legendary status from 1989 
    once again. Originally, the song was released in the <stong>Like a Prayer<strong> album back in 1989 
    with a few other select hits like <strong>Express Yourself<strong> and <strong>Cherish<strong> 

</p>Being the first song of Madonna's fourth album, it gained massive popularity and also lots of 
widespread criticism due to the heavy religious connotations and theming shown in both the song and 
the music video. Fast-forward thirty five years from its release, lots of the criticisms have subsided 
due to the shift in musical ideologies and is now enjoyed as a masterfully crafted classic song of the 
1980s which still has some of the best musical tropes and ideas til this day. 
<p>
 
</p>Madonna's musical scene was well established during the 1980s as a result of a few of her other 
albums like <strong>Like a Virgin<strong> and <strong>True Blue<strong> which both had numerous hits on 
the charts like <strong>Material Girl<strong>, <strong>Like a Virgin<strong> and <strong>La Isla Bonita<strong> to
 say a few. Personally I have enjoyed a few of her songs from these albums through their different 
 motifs, themes and musical structure all making them memorable, however none were particularly as 
 impactful, vocally and musically as <strong>Like a Prayer<strong>.

<p>I got first introduced to the original song in 2018, searching through some of the greatest hits 
    on Spotify and Youtube. At the time I was the sort of person to follow the radio for new songs to 
    listen to as my tastes for modern mainstream music was virtually non-existent. Unfortunately for the 
    radio, the song was shortened, leaving out some of the enjoyment I had with the song. As a result, 
    it was clear that I had to find the full song and experience all 5:41 minutes of it. Now that the 
    Deadpool & Wolverine version was released, Listening to the song and its different iterations in the 
    track listing below from the movie, breathed a new life into this timeless hit.

<h2>Impressions</h2>
<p>Oh where to begin! I have listened to this song time and time again after so many years, 
    even after chopping and changing numerous others from my music collection. To begin with, 
    the opening guitar when the song starts playing gives off a chaotic beginning with quick note 
    progression highlighting the outside business before a sudden slam from a door decaying with a 
    massive echo filling the room with a sense of air. Now interestingly the echo of the door occurs 
    on the direct right hand side of the listener which gives off a wide sense of stage and also sets 
    the expectations of the other elements of the song as it plays along. It was clear that the stage 
    of the song was set with the guitar completely disappearing from the scene after being shut away by 
    the church door leaving only the choir and Madonna to start their act.
</p>

<p>Immediately it is apparent that a Church setting was established for the scene with a choir positioned 
    in back centre with the organ on the slight right hand side giving a sense of spaciousness. Madonna's calm
    vocals come into the scene with the choir building up behind her as she progresses through the lyrics. Soon after
    a spakling ethereal like sound accompanied by a shaker is played before the complete instrumentation bursts into the 
    song with a percussive melody and a bass synth rhythm complementing Madonna's Vocals. The constrast between the 
    low end bass rhythm and drum progression and the vocals with the cymbals and hihats bring forward such great clarity
    that they enhance each other's presence as a result. By the way if you are listening to this song, try to follow each 
    of the different instruments, they are very distinct!
</p>

<p>Progressing through the song, the instrumentation switches up multiple times between the heavenly sound of the 
    choir and the weighty low end might of the percussion and synth, mixing the smoothness of the vocals with the 
    punchiness of the kick drum making the song pop out more keeping the energy well maintained (especially for a post 5
    minute song!). Now the clarity of everything in the song so far is absolute perfection. All instrumnets are presented clearly
    and are arranged very well with a wide and deep sense of stage mimicing a concert stage hall. Not many songs are this well mastered 
    and usually have evident flaws and limitations, not in this case though as even minor sounds like the very quiet organ sneaking its 
    way into the song can be heard so clearly!
</p>

<p>Getting back on track with the song, after two cycles of the main rhythm, the bridge makes itself known by dialing back some 
    of the energy that was present in the chorus and replacing that energy with the bass guitar and drums bringing in a strong rhythmic progression  
    with the choir vocals responding to every line sung. This intensity increases with every line building up in volume before being released with a long extended note before handing off 
    to the choir, briefly taking over the vocal role, responding to Madonna's lyrics, offering to "take you there". Interestingly, during that little 
    segment, the main choir is positioned in the middle but there is one main choir singer positioned directly off to the right creating the 
    harmonious ties with the main choir and Madonna. The song continues to run the chorus one final time but this time with a less bright tone before concluding
    and fading out. Each time the chorus appears in the song, it is performed differently, one as an introduction, the second with more energy and determination, the third
    with a sense of doubt and finally the fourth with a feeling of acceptance. To me the song goes through the stages of belief and doubt, constantly calling out to the voices
    to "take me there" and its like a dream, it provokes religious elements, especially when the music video aired with the burning cross during the bridge, turning the theme
    very dark and switching the flow of the song.
</p>

<p> Now, hold on there are two more songs left, yes they are remixes of the original but are interesting changes which were featured in the movie. 
    The 'Battle Royale' mix gives an a heavily remixed take where Madonna's vocals are ever so slightly thinned out 
    but the instrumentation has an added base heft which was fitting for the trailers' fast paced and punchy action (no pun intended :P). 
    Now the 'Choir Version' completely takes the choir element from the song and makes itself comfortable being the third track in the single 
    making a relaxing and ethereal atmosphere with some synthesiser buildup near the end. There were some vocals scattered around the song but are more 
    for keeping with the angelic theming of the song. Yes both of these versions are not as long and also probably not made to be listened to regularly 
    but its nice to see that there was an effort to release the remixes for those who enjoyed them along with the movie (including me!)
</p>

<p>Listening to the song, it scales really well with whichever thing you are using to listen. Infact it is just an enjoyable 
    song, nevermind the equipment! However, listening through a number of mediums from Youtube and Spotify through to listening on 
    my independent DAPs (Digital Audio Players), it is evident that a lot of work was put in to perfect the arrangement and mastering 
    of the song. On the DAPs, the soundstage comes alive with lots of height and depth with a high dynamic range making me grin everytime 
    it plays. Key things to look out for is the drum progression throughout the song and how it changes with each section and also the choir and
    their positioning in the song and how they are able to freely be a prominent feature in accompyning the lead vocals. Basically, the song rewards those 
    who highly value vocals, staging and positioning. Given that the song is 5:40 min it is safe to say this exceeds my reference of 3:30 min for what is considered
    to be an average song length, giving lots of emotion without letting up. There was no point throughout in feeling that the song was too short and I was left satisfied with the 
    length and felt that it was well paced and structured.
</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>This has been a long journey writing all this out and I think that <strong>Like a Prayer</strong> is well deserved in taking my listening time on multiple ocassions.
    Ever since I have started listening to the song, it has remained as one of my reference songs for demoing any new gear, being so well crafted and enjoyable.
    It was surprising to see this song emerge once again in 2024 and has reminded me that even though it is over 30 year old, it still remains as a timeless 
    hit. Even though I don't listen to the song frequently as some others, it is always a breath of fresh air to come back to and experience once again, the musical 
    motivation of the late 80s which sets itself infinetly apart from modern day musical motifs. Do take a listen and who knows, it may come out as one of the most memorable and unique 
    songs you'd ever cross.
