<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> Six months ago, an unlikely artist was featured in one of the biggest movies of 2024. <strong>Like a Prayer<strong>from Madonna reached the ears of millions of people during its debut in the trailers of Deadpool & Wolverine reviving the song's once legendary status from 1989 once again. Originally, the song was released in the <stong>Like a Prayer<strong> album back in 1989 with a few other select hits like <strong>Express Yourself<strong> and <strong>Cherish<strong> 

</p>Being the first song of Madonna's fourth album, it gained massive popularity and also lots of widespread criticism due to the heavy religious connotations and theming shown in both the song and the music video. Fast-forward thirty five years from its release, lots of the criticisms have subsided due to the shift in musical ideologies and is now enjoyed as a masterfully crafted classic song of the 1980s which still has some of the best musical tropes and ideas til this day. 
<p>
 
</p>Madonna's musical scene was well established during the 1980s as a result of a few of her other albums like <strong>Like a Virgin<strong> and <strong>True Blue<strong> which both had numerous hits on the charts like <strong>Material Girl<strong>, <strong>Like a Virgin<strong> and <strong>La Isla Bonita<strong> to say a few. Personally I have enjoyed a few of her songs from these albums through their different motifs, themes and musical structure all making them memorable, however none were particularly as impactful, vocally and musically as <strong>Like a Prayer>.

<p>I got first introduced to the original song in 2018, searching through some of the greatest hits on Spotify and Youtube. At the time I was the sort of person to follow the radio for new songs to listen to as my tastes for modern mainstream music was virtually non-existent. Unfortunately for the radio, the song was shortened, leaving out some of the enjoyment I had with the song. As a result, it was clear that I had to find the full song and experience all 5:41 minutes of it. Now that the Deadpool & Wolverine version was released, Listening to the song and its different iterations in the track listing below from the movie, breathed a new life into this timeless hit.

<h2>Impressions</h2>
<p>Oh where to begin! I have listened to this song time and time again after so many years, even after chopping and changing numerous others from my music collection. To begin with, the opening guitar when the song starts playing gives off a chaotic beginning with quick note progression highlighting the outside business before a sudden slam from a door decaying with a massive echo filling the room with a sense of air. Now interestingly the echo of the door occurs on the direct right hand side of the listener which gives off a wide sense of stage and also sets the expectations of the other elements of the song as it plays along. It was clear that the stage of the song was set with the guitar completely disappearing from the scene after being shut away by the church door leaving only the choir and Madonna to start their act. 

</p>Immediately it is apparent that a Church setting was selected for the scene with a choir positioned in back centre with the organ on the slight right hand side.
