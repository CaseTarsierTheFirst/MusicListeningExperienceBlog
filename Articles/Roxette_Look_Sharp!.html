            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Look Sharp! album by Roxette was my first introduction to the music worldd which I started listening to way back in 2018. I still remember when I first heard their song <strong>Dangerous<strong> on the radio, it stuck in my mind as a rememberable song of which I had to search on Youtube and discover more. At the time, I wasn't that fascinated with the music scene, let alone the 1980s music scene of pop and rock, however this was a first. My first though of discovering Roxette was lackluster where there were only a few songs of which piqued my interest such as <strong>The Look<strong>, <strong>Dangerous<strong> and <strong>Dressed For Success<strong>. In fact below is the full track listing for the album for convenience</p>
            
            <h2>Tracklist</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The Look</li>
                <li>Dressed For Success</li>
                <li>Sleeping Single</li>
                <li>Paint</li>
                <li>Dance Away</li>
                <li>Cry</li>
                <li>Chances</li>
                <li>Dangerous</li>
                <li>Half a Woman</li>
                <li>View from a Hill</li>
                <li>Shadow of a Doubt</li>
                <li>Listen To Your Heart</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Impressions</h2>
            <p>After looking at the track list, nothing seemed to stand out. Standard song durations, news cover like album cover and 13 tracks, just like any other album until I listend to a few other songs like <strong>Paint<strong> and <strong>Sleeping Single<strong> of which completely changed the overall feeling of the album from lukewarm to colourfully mastered. These two songs take a unique change from the usual style of the earlier three songs and gave a different take on style with more emphasis on electric synths and the unique vocals that Marie Fredricksson provides. 

Now for those who are reading this there is one particular song that I haven't mentioned that did leave a deep impression on me which is <strong>Listen To Your Heart<strong>. When I fired up the song on my old Ipad Air 2 which was school issued, it blew me away how much the vocal range spanned so widely and gave so much emotion during its play time. Throughout the song the melodious piano and synth duo allowed more emphasis on the vocals with well placed guitar riffs and melodies to create a impactful melody which as a result created one of Roxette's most listened songs of all time. 

After the Look Sharp! experience, I ended up looking more at Roxette, viewing more of their releases like <strong>Joyride<strong> and <strong>Crash Boom Bang<strong> (of which will be discussed at a future time) and realised that they were way bigger in presence in the music world than just the single album that I listen to. However it would take me over a year to get round to listening to more of their works.

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>This album was the first of many to cross my ears and has left an unforgettable memory in my journey through music listening. Even now at 7 years later I still revisit the album to relive that experience and to constrast their unique musical style with many of the other tracks that I listen to now .</p>
