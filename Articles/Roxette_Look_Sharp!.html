            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Look Sharp! album by Roxette was my first introduction to the music world which I started listening to way back in 2018. I still remember when I first heard their song <strong>Dangerous</strong> on the radio, it stuck in my mind as a memorable song, which I had to search on YouTube and discover more. At the time, I wasn't that fascinated with the music scene, let alone the 1980s music scene of pop and rock. However, this was a first.</p>

            <p>My first thought of discovering Roxette was lackluster, where there were only a few songs that piqued my interest such as <strong>The Look</strong>, <strong>Dangerous</strong>, and <strong>Dressed For Success</strong>. In fact, below is the full track listing for the album for your convenience.</p>

            <h2>Tracklist</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The Look</li>
                <li>Dressed For Success</li>
                <li>Sleeping Single</li>
                <li>Paint</li>
                <li>Dance Away</li>
                <li>Cry</li>
                <li>Chances</li>
                <li>Dangerous</li>
                <li>Half a Woman</li>
                <li>View from a Hill</li>
                <li>Shadow of a Doubt</li>
                <li>Listen To Your Heart</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Impressions</h2>
            <p>After looking at the tracklist, nothing seemed to stand out. Standard song durations, album cover... but once I listened to a few other songs like <strong>Paint</strong> and <strong>Sleeping Single</strong>, my view changed. These two songs provided a unique style with more emphasis on electric synths and the distinct vocals of Marie Fredricksson.</p>

            <p>Now, there is one particular song that left a deep impression on me, which is <strong>Listen To Your Heart</strong>. When I first played it on my old iPad Air 2, it blew me away with the vocal range and the emotional depth. The melodious piano and synth duo allowed more emphasis on the vocals with well-placed guitar riffs, creating one of Roxette's most iconic tracks.</p>

            <p>After Look Sharp!, I ended up exploring more of Roxette‚Äôs work, like <strong>Joyride</strong> and <strong>Crash Boom Bang</strong> (which will be discussed in the future). I realized that they were much bigger in the music scene than I initially thought. However, it took me over a year to explore more of their music.</p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>This album was the first of many to shape my journey through music listening. Even now, seven years later, I still revisit it to relive that experience and compare it to the other tracks I listen to today.</p>
