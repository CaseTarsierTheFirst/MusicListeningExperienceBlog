            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Look Sharp! album by Roxette was my first introduction to the music world which I started 
                listening to way back in 2018. I still remember when I first heard their song <strong>Dangerous</strong> 
                on the radio, it stuck in my mind as a memorable song, which I had to search on YouTube and discover more. 
                At the time, I wasn't that fascinated with the music scene, let alone the 1980s music scene of pop and rock. 
                However, this was a first.</p>

            <p> Roxette is a Swedish duo consisting of Marie Fredricksson and Per Gessle of whom Marie was the main vocalist
                and Per was the songwriter (for the majority of their songs). There were other Swedish bands that have made their
                mark in the musid industry like ABBA in the 70s and it seemed that Roxette took the late 80s an early 90s
            </p>

            <p>My first thought of discovering Roxette was lackluster (yeah my past self wasnt that observent or critical), 
                where there were only a few songs from their album that piqued my interest 
                such as <strong>The Look</strong>, <strong>Dangerous</strong>, and <strong>Dressed For Success</strong>. These 
                three songs were some that I liked at the time for their energetic playstyle andd clear cut vocals from the duo which 
                contrasted with each other well like a musical jigsaw.
                In fact those were only a few I knew from the album, below is the full track listing for the album for your convenience.</p>

            <h2>Tracklist</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The Look</li>
                <li>Dressed For Success</li>
                <li>Sleeping Single</li>
                <li>Paint</li>
                <li>Dance Away</li>
                <li>Cry</li>
                <li>Chances</li>
                <li>Dangerous</li>
                <li>Half a Woman</li>
                <li>View from a Hill</li>
                <li>(I Could Never) Give Up</li>
                <li>Shadow of a Doubt</li>
                <li>Listen To Your Heart</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Impressions</h2>
            <p>After looking at the tracklist, nothing seemed to stand out. Standard song durations, newsletter album cover and 13 individual 
                songs seemed pretty standard however once I listened to a few other songs like <strong>Paint</strong> and <strong>Sleeping Single</strong>, 
                my view dramatically changed. These two songs provided a unique style with more emphasis on electric synths and the distinct vocals of Marie 
                Fredricksson. <strong>Paint</strong> seemed like a direct antithesis from <strong>Dressed For Success</strong>
                where her vocals would be more smooth and velvety rather than sharp, loud and bold. </p>

            <p>Now, there is one particular song that left a deep impression on me, which is <strong>Listen To 
                Your Heart</strong>. When I first played it on my old iPad Air 2, it blew me away with the 
                vocal range and the emotional depth. Like <strong>Sleeping Single</strong> with the strong vocals,
                Marie's voice proceeds to be accompanied by the melodious piano and synth duo allowing more emphasis 
                on the vocals with well-placed guitar riffs, creating one of Roxette's most iconic tracks.</p>

            <p>After Look Sharp!, I ended up exploring more of Roxette‚Äôs works both past and future, 
                like <strong>Joyride</strong>, <strong>Crash Boom Bang</strong> and even <strong>Pearls of Passion</strong>
                (which will be discussed in the future). I realized that they were much bigger 
                in the music scene than I initially thought, (yes I couldn't believe they released so many songs!). 
                However, it took me over a year later to explore more of their music.</p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>This album was the first of many to shape my journey through music listening and also the style of the late 80s. 
                Even now, seven years later, I still revisit the album to relive that experience and compare 
                it to the other tracks I listen to today.</p>
